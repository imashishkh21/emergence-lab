# Phase 3 Progress: Specialization Detection

## Session Start
Date: 2026-02-02
Previous Phases:
- Phase 1 COMPLETE: Field carries info (Normal 63 >> Zeroed 23)
- Phase 2 COMPLETE: Evolution works (pop=32, births≈deaths, 174 tests pass)

## Phase 3 Goal
Detect when agents evolve into different "species" with distinct strategies.
Prove that field enables DIVERSITY, not just higher reward.

## Key Insight from Phase 2
- Random field HURTS agents (585 < 600) → they learned to READ field
- Field might enable specialization, not just coordination
