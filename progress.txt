# Phase 5 Progress: Prove Emergence

## Session Start
Date: 2026-02-03
Previous Phases: Phase 1 (Digital Petri Dish), Phase 2 (Evolutionary Pressure), Phase 3 (Specialization Detection), Phase 4 (Research Microscope), Phase 4B (Kaggle Infrastructure) — all COMPLETE

## Phase 5 Goal
Prove with rigorous information-theoretic metrics and statistical significance that collective intelligence emerges from simple agents + shared field + evolution. Beat classical swarm AND modern MARL baselines. Publication-ready figures.

## Key Insights from Previous Phases
- Random field HURTS agents (585 < 600) — they learned to READ the field for information
- Specialization emerges with evolution: scouts, exploiters, balanced agents
- Weight divergence tracks with behavioral clustering
- Population reaches equilibrium (32/32 maxed): 108 births + 108 deaths = perfect turnover
- 9.8M steps trained on Kaggle (checkpoint available)

## Codebase Patterns
- Trackers follow pattern: __init__(), update(), get_metrics(), get_summary() — see TransferEntropyTracker
- All baselines return standardized result dict: {"total_reward", "food_collected", "final_population", "per_agent_rewards"}
- EnvState is flax.struct.dataclass — adding fields requires updating EVERY constructor call (state.py, env.py, ablation.py)
- Phase 5 deps go in [project.optional-dependencies] under "phase5" group with @pytest.mark.skipif guards
- Config uses dataclass_field(default_factory=...) for nested configs
- Field conditions in ablation.py: use FieldCondition Literal type
- Tests use jax.random.PRNGKey for deterministic testing

## Task Log

### US-001: Phase 5 Dependencies and Library Verification ✓
**Date:** 2026-02-03
**What:** Added dit, hoi, rliable to pyproject.toml [phase5] group. Created smoke tests.
**Decisions:**
- jaxmarl excluded from phase5 deps — pins jax<=0.4.38 and scipy<=1.12, incompatible with our jax 0.9 + scipy 1.17. We write custom MAPPO instead.
- dit requires numpy compat patch (np.alltrue removed in NumPy 2.0) — monkey-patched in test setup
- rliable.metrics works fine; rliable.library bootstrap has arch 8.0 compat issue (passes None as random_state). Metrics-only usage is sufficient for US-011.
- hoi requires float64 data and jax_enable_x64 for proper computation
- System deps needed: brew install cddlib gmp glpk suite-sparse (for dit's cvxopt/pycddlib)
**Files changed:**
- `pyproject.toml` — added phase5 optional-dependencies group
- `tests/test_phase5_deps.py` — NEW: 13 smoke tests (12 pass, 1 skip for jaxmarl)
**Verification:** mypy clean, ruff clean, 744 tests pass (1 skip)

### US-002: O-Information Metric via hoi ✓
**Date:** 2026-02-03
**What:** Implemented O-information (Omega = TC - DTC) metric using hoi library. Omega < 0 indicates synergy-dominant emergence.
**Decisions:**
- Using hoi's Gaussian Copula method ("gc") for fast continuous-data O-info estimation
- Returns 0.0 for edge cases: <3 agents (O-info undefined), <10 samples, constant features, NaN inputs
- Added noise injection (1e-8 scale) to avoid numerical issues with near-constant dimensions
- OInformationTracker follows same pattern as TransferEntropyTracker with z-score phase transition detection
- Tracks synergy_ratio: cumulative fraction of negative O-info values (emergence signal)
**Files changed:**
- `src/analysis/o_information.py` — NEW: compute_o_information(), compute_o_information_by_condition(), OInfoEvent, OInformationTracker
- `tests/test_o_information.py` — NEW: 27 tests covering all functions and edge cases
**Verification:** mypy clean, ruff clean, 27/27 tests pass
